<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I was raised in a relatively conservative Christian household - a son of a pastor of youth, music, and basically everything else that wasn’t preaching on Sunday morning or visiting the old people. Homeschooled too, all the way through. It wasn’t until I was 15 years old that I finally started to encounter a wider range of music, outside of Contemporary Christian, some heavily-Jesus-themed music in a subsection of genres, classical and, occasionally, Chicago that I was exposed to by my parents. Of course, I also encountered the top of the top charts pop elsewhere.<br>
Since then, I've done my best to barrel through as much music as I possibly could, with my tastes constantly evolving and changing as I was exposed to new things - but I've barely scratched the surface. There’s a lot I could unpack & explore concerning how that lack of… context? for greater media, culture, literature, and music, has and still affects me, made me who I am today. This may be the start. I think that lack of context even had some positives.<br>
Here are my top 100 songs, as they stand at the time I finally force myself to stop with the list making and start the writing - Wednesday, Dec. 4th, 2024 at 9:44pm. Some will have stories, others won’t. I’ll explain myself sometimes, often I won’t have an explanation. Okay - I’ll still have to change the list, because I’m starting writing and just cut it down to 98 songs because I realized #100 didn’t deserve its spot. By no means is this a list  meant to be objective as that would be impossible for me to create - I’ve missed too many of the greats & still get exposed to more of them every day. But this is my list.<br>
If you want to listen along, I’ll do my best to link every song to my prefered version of it on Youtube & there’s also a Spotify playlist for each batch (and eventually all 100). I hope you enjoy the songs I love and that have shaped the last 13 years of, well, me. :)
